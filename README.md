# GitDiagram

Turn any GitHub repository into an interactive diagram for visualization in seconds.

You can also replace `hub` with `diagram` in any Github URL to access its diagram.

## 🚀 Features

- 👀 **Instant Visualization**: Convert any GitHub repository structure into a system design / architecture diagram
- 🎨 **Interactivity**: Click on components to navigate directly to source files and relevant directories
- ⚡ **Fast Generation**: Powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet for quick and accurate diagrams
- 🔄 **Customization**: Modify and regenerate diagrams with custom instructions
- 🌐 **API Access**: Public API available for integration (WIP)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, Server Actions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with Drizzle ORM)
- **AI**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), EC2 (Backend)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Analytics**: PostHog, Api-Analytics

## 🛠️ Self-hosting / Local Development

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedkhaleel2004/gitdiagram.git
cd gitdiagram
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

3. Set up environment variables (create .env)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file with your Anthropic API key and optional GitHub personal access token.

4. Run backend

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Logs available at `docker-compose logs -f`
The FastAPI server will be available at `localhost:8000`

5. Start local database

```bash
chmod +x start-database.sh
./start-database.sh
```

When prompted to generate a random password, input yes.
The Postgres database will start in a container at `localhost:5432`

6. Initialize the database schema

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

You can view and interact with the database using `pnpm db:studio`

7. Run Frontend

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can now access the website at `localhost:3000` and edit the rate limits defined in `backend/app/routers/generate.py` in the generate function decorator.

## 📈 Rate Limits

I am currently hosting it for free with the following rate limits. If you would like to bypass these, self-hosting instructions are provided. I also plan on adding an input for your own Anthropic API key.

Diagram generation:

- 1 request per minute
- 5 requests per day

## 🤔 Future Steps

- Can use cheaper, larger context models like Gemini 1206
- Allow user to enter Anthropic API Key for use at own cost
- Implement RAG with Mermaid.js docs
- Implement font-awesome icons in diagram
